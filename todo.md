# Requirements Matrix

| # | Change Request | End State + Value Add | Priority | Complexity | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | I want to **change** minimize/exit behavior (arm/disarm/quit + taskbar/tray interactions). | App has clear, predictable controls for collapse, expand, arm/disarm, and quit without conflicting states between header controls and system tray. **Value add:** reduces user confusion and accidental app state mismatch. | High | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 2 | I want to **fix** screenshot hotkey behavior when app is focused (Alt key issue). | Screenshot shortcuts work consistently even when Jarvis window has focus. **Value add:** improves reliability for snipping workflow. | High | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 3 | I want to **enhance** Provider UI so Validate and Default are more prominent and less confusing. | Provider rows clearly show validation state and default selection with stronger visual hierarchy/colors. **Value add:** faster setup, fewer wrong-provider mistakes. | High | Low | Not Started | - |
| 4 | I want to **add** configurable provider inactivity timeout across providers (default 1 min, max 5 min). | Settings panel includes timeout control (1–5 minutes, default 1). Idle sessions auto-terminate based on selected value. **Value add:** better cost control and user control over live sessions. | Critical | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 5 | I want to **change** Provider Save behavior so the settings panel minimizes after save. | Clicking Save in Provider tab applies changes and collapses the window to compact mode. **Value add:** cleaner workflow after provider updates. | Medium | Low | Not Started | - |
| 6 | I want to **enhance** voice keyword coverage (text-edit commands + Windows app launch commands). | Expanded and validated command set for editing actions (clear/next line/etc.) and launching common Windows apps. **Value add:** broader hands-free productivity and fewer command misses. | High | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 7 | I want to **enhance** microphone device refresh behavior when new devices are connected. | Audio device list can refresh without app restart (manual refresh now; optional auto-detect later). **Value add:** smoother headset/mic switching experience. | Medium | Low | Not Started | - |
| 8 | I want to **improve** snipping action labels/tooltips (copy path, copy image, open in paint). | Buttons and hover help text are explicit and user-friendly for each snip action. **Value add:** fewer misclicks and better discoverability. | Medium | Low | Not Started | - |
| 9 | I want to **add** support to launch Snipping Tool directly (as an alternative to Paint flow). | Voice/app action can open Snipping Tool directly and be testable from command flow. **Value add:** faster capture flow with native Windows tooling. | Medium | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 10 | I want to **add** release/update workflow (GitHub releases, update indicator, optional auto-update, release notes). | App shows update availability, supports opt-in auto-update, and exposes release notes; manual update remains available when auto-update is off. **Value add:** safer distribution, better release visibility, lower maintenance friction. | Critical | High | Not Started | - |
| 11 | I want to **add** configurable screenshot retention count in Pictures (instead of fixed 5 files). | Settings allow user to choose how many recent captured images to keep; app automatically prunes older files beyond that limit. **Value add:** better control over disk usage and history depth. | High | Low | Not Started | - |
| 12 | I want to **enhance** the Usage settings section to show correct metrics and clean visuals. | Usage page displays accurate, provider-aligned metrics (with clear labels/units/time windows) and a simplified, cleaner layout for faster readability. **Value add:** better trust in data and easier performance/cost monitoring. | High | Medium | Not Started | - |
| 13 | I want to **add** native packaging of cue audio files into the EXE as part of build. | Build process embeds cue audio assets directly in the binary so runtime does not depend on external audio files beside the EXE. **Value add:** simpler distribution, fewer missing-file issues, cleaner installs. | High | Medium | Not Started | - |
