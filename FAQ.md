# Mango Chat FAQ

## What happens when you start Mango Chat?
When you start recording, Mango Chat listens for audio from your device and streams it to your selected provider for transcription. Place your cursor in a text field to begin dictating.

## Where are my API keys stored?
API keys are encrypted at rest and stored locally on your machine in `AppData/Local/MangoChat`. They are only transmitted over secure connections when authenticating with your chosen provider.

## Does Mango Chat collect telemetry or personal information?
Mango Chat has no built-in telemetry. During recording, audio is sent only to your selected provider for transcription.

## What are the hotkeys to start and stop Mango Chat?
In addition to the start/stop buttons on the UI, you can use `Right Ctrl` to start and stop recording when that hotkey is enabled in settings.

## Why do I sometimes experience delays or inaccurate transcription?
These are provider-dependent and may be caused by audio quality, speech clarity, network latency, or inherent limitations of the model.

## How do I take a screenshot?
When screenshot capture is enabled, move your cursor to the monitor you want, press `Right Alt`, then select the region.

## What happens after I capture a screenshot?
Based on your settings, Mango Chat can copy the image path, copy the image content, or open it in Paint for editing.

## Where are screenshots saved?
Use `Open images folder` in Settings to open the active screenshot directory.

## How much does transcription cost?
It depends on the chosen provider and model. Pricing is typically per second or per hour. Deepgram and AssemblyAI often provide free trial credits; check their sites for current details.

## Which providers are supported?
Deepgram, OpenAI Realtime, ElevenLabs Realtime, and AssemblyAI.
